#Sudoku
A Sudoku board class with built in solver functions. The main has a command line interface for entering playing and solving sudoku boards. Includes 5 hard coded boards and allows entering custom boards. The Undo class is used by the interface to allow undo when playing a board.
##About
I wrote this code for my CS201 Intro to C++ class at University of Alaska, Fairbanks Spring 2014.
With the exception of the makefile, the code I submitted for the class is the first commit in this repo.
I have since made some minor changes for publishing it here.
I have added comments and changed some function names for clarity and cleaned up some logic.
I may continue to add some comments to the Sudoku class and update this README.md with more information about how my solver functions work but I don't expect to make many more changes to this code.
The main program no doubt has some bugs in the interface but I don't intent to fix those.

##Use
Feel free to use, modify, play with, or learn from this code.
Please just clearly give credit with a link to this repo in your code if you use any of mine.
Though you don't have to, I would be happy to hear that looked at my code.
I will be adding contact information here shortly.

##Build and run
Navigate into the folder containing the repo

`$ cd /path/to/sudoku_bool`

Run make

`$ make`

Run *play_sudoku*

`$ ./play_sudoku`

##Bugs
It is no doubt easy to break my main program. 
I won't be making any changes to main.cpp, Undo.cpp, or Undo.h.
However, if you find a bug in the Sudoku class, I would be interested in fixing that.
